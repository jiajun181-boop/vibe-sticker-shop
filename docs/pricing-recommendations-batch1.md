## Business Cards (8 SKUs) — QTY_OPTIONS model

All 8 share the same preset structure with multiplier-based pricing relative to Classic.

### Pricing Strategy
- Classic is the **loss leader** — priced at market median -5% to drive trials
- Each premium stock applies a multiplier reflecting real cost delta + margin premium
- Gold foil is the **margin anchor** at 1.55x classic with few direct competitors

### Multiplier Table

| SKU | Multiplier | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| classic | 1.00x | Commodity baseline |
| matte | 1.12x | Slight coating cost |
| gloss | 1.18x | Gloss coating + UV option |
| linen | 1.22x | Specialty textured stock |
| pearl | 1.28x | Shimmer stock premium |
| soft-touch | 1.30x | Lamination process |
| thick (32pt) | 1.35x | Double stock weight |
| gold-foil | 1.55x | Foil stamping process |
