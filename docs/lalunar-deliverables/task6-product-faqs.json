        {
          "question": "What material options are available for stickers and labels?",
          "answer": "Vinyl is usually the best choice for outdoor use because it handles moisture and handling better than paper labels. Paper labels are a good fit for indoor packaging and short-term promotions where cost efficiency matters."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the difference between the main stickers and labels options?",
          "answer": "Die-cut stickers are cut through the vinyl and backing to the shape of the design, while kiss-cut stickers keep a larger backing sheet for easier peeling. Sticker sheets place multiple designs on one sheet and are popular for giveaways, packs, and small retail sets."
        },
        {
          "question": "How durable are your stickers and labels?",
          "answer": "Many vinyl options are water-resistant and can be laminated for better UV and scratch protection. Tell us how the sticker or label will be used and we can recommend the right material for indoor or outdoor conditions."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are these products for indoor or outdoor use?",
          "answer": "For storefront glass, equipment, and outdoor use, we usually recommend durable vinyl-based materials. For indoor packaging or event handouts, paper labels or simpler sticker formats may be the better value."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the minimum order quantity?",
          "answer": "Minimum quantities vary by format, size, and production method, but we can support small runs for testing designs or launching a new product. If you are not sure where to start, we can suggest the most cost-effective quantity for your use case."
        },
        {
          "question": "What file format do you need for artwork?",
          "answer": "Print-ready PDF, AI, EPS, or a high-resolution PNG is preferred, and vector files are best for sharp text and accurate cut lines. For custom shapes, include bleed and a cut path if possible, and we will review the file before production."
        },
        {
          "question": "How fast is turnaround and pickup in the GTA?",
          "answer": "Because we produce locally, many standard sticker and label jobs can be scheduled for same-day or next-day pickup when files are ready. Pickup is available at 11 Progress Ave #21, Scarborough, ON, and we also offer delivery options across the GTA."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you provide installation guidance?",
          "answer": "Apply decals and labels to a clean, dry surface and press gradually to avoid bubbles or wrinkles. For larger decals on glass or painted surfaces, a squeegee and careful alignment make a big difference."

        },
        {
          "question": "What is the difference between the main marketing and business print options?",
          "answer": "Flyers are great for quick promotions, postcards work well for mail, and brochures are better when you need more room for information. Rack cards are a strong option for counters, clinics, lobbies, and tourism displays."
        },
        {
          "question": "How durable are your marketing and business print?",
          "answer": "Most paper-based marketing print is designed for indoor use or short-term distribution. For outdoor exposure, signs, banners, or decals are usually a better choice than paper products."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are these products for indoor or outdoor use?",
          "answer": "Use paper print for indoor marketing, meetings, mailers, and in-store handouts. For outdoor campaigns or weather exposure, we can help you move the design to a sign or banner format."

          "question": "What is the minimum order quantity?",

        {
          "question": "What file format do you need for artwork?",
          "answer": "A print-ready PDF with bleed and safe margins is ideal, and vector-based files are preferred when available. We can also review AI, PSD, and high-resolution image files and flag common issues before production."

        {
          "question": "What material options are available for signs and rigid boards?",
          "answer": "Coroplast is a common choice for temporary outdoor signs like yard signs, while foam board is often used for clean indoor displays. PVC board is more rigid and durable than foam board and is a strong option for longer-term indoor use and some light outdoor applications."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the difference between the main signs and rigid boards options?",
          "answer": "Coroplast is lightweight and cost-effective for outdoor temporary signage, while foam board is better for indoor presentation and event display use. PVC boards are more durable and give a sturdier feel for display and mounting projects."
        },
        {
          "question": "How durable are your signs and rigid boards?",
          "answer": "Durability depends on the substrate, thickness, exposure, and installation method. We can recommend the right board and finishing based on whether your sign is for a short event, a seasonal campaign, or longer-term use."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are these products for indoor or outdoor use?",
          "answer": "Yard and real estate signs are typically made with outdoor-ready coroplast, while foam board and some photo/display boards are better suited for indoor use. If your sign may be exposed to weather, tell us the location and duration before ordering."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the minimum order quantity?",
          "answer": "We can produce single signs as well as bulk runs for campaigns, events, and real estate teams. Quantity pricing usually improves when sizes and layouts are standardized."
        },
        {
          "question": "What file format do you need for artwork?",
          "answer": "Vector files such as PDF, AI, or EPS are preferred for signs because text and logos stay sharp at larger sizes. For photo-heavy boards, use high-resolution images at or near final print size."
        },
        {
          "question": "How fast is turnaround and pickup in the GTA?",

          "question": "Do you provide installation guidance?",

          "question": "What material options are available for banners and event displays?",
          "answer": "Vinyl banners are a versatile option for many indoor and outdoor uses, mesh banners are better for windy areas, and fabric banners are popular for indoor displays and trade shows. We can recommend the best material based on location, event duration, and installation method."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the difference between the main banners and event displays options?",
          "answer": "Vinyl banners are the all-around choice, mesh banners are built for airflow outdoors, and fabric banners offer a more premium look for indoor events. Retractable, X-banners, flags, and backdrops are display systems that pair graphics with hardware."
        },
        {
          "question": "How durable are your banners and event displays?",
          "answer": "Durability depends on the material, finishing, wind exposure, and how the product is installed and stored. For repeat events or outdoor use, choosing the right material and hardware matters more than just picking the lowest price."

        {
          "question": "Are these products for indoor or outdoor use?",
          "answer": "Many products in this category support outdoor use, but the correct choice depends on wind, weather, and setup location. For indoor trade shows, fabric displays and retractable systems are common because they look clean and are easy to transport."

          "question": "What is the minimum order quantity?",
          "answer": "Most banner and display products can be ordered as a single unit, which is useful for one-time events and test setups. We can also quote multi-unit runs for chains, franchises, and recurring events."

        {
          "question": "What file format do you need for artwork?",
          "answer": "Print-ready PDF or vector artwork is preferred, and large-format graphics should include final dimensions and bleed where required. If you are using photos, make sure they are high resolution enough for viewing distance and output size."

          "question": "What is the difference between the main canvas prints options?",
          "answer": "A gallery wrap is stretched canvas with the image wrapped around the edges, while a framed canvas adds an outer frame for a more finished presentation. Multi-panel canvas layouts split one image across multiple pieces for a feature wall effect."

          "question": "How durable are your canvas prints?",
